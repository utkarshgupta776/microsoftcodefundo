# Microsoft Codefundo Idea:

## Problems faced during election:

1.	Voters do not easily get the information of the members of different political parties like Attendance in the House, Promises made vs. Kept, Criminal Record, Questions asked in the House, Number of Debates participated in, etc. which they should know before selecting their representatives.

2.	Unavailability of polling booths or transportation problems to the polling space or the long queues inside it makes it very difficult and time-consuming for the general citizens of the country.

## Planning to build:
I am planning to build an application which will help the people from all the above mentioned problems with the use of blockchain technology and data handling.

## How it works:

By the use of blockchain technology, we will be able to remove most of the rendering problems like data tampering and create a foundation to enable voting by mobile phones. 

Blockchain’s rigid ledger can help store identity data for authenticating voters, and help securely record digital votes for tabulation. With the use data handling and management, the data of all the politicians will be stored, archived or disposed off in a safe and secure manner during and after the elections. The information will be represented in different forms through which people can easily navigate and extract useful things and select the appropriate candidate. 	

Individual voters and election officials can each audit the election’s outcome on a public blockchain.

## How people can use it:


The application will use a platform which uses a webcam and government-issued ID to allow voters to remotely and securely log in to cast votes. After they’ve selected their candidates, they can use their unique voter ID to open the virtual ballot box and verify their vote is present and correct. This way voters can effectively submit their vote without revealing their identity or political preferences to the public. 

Officials can count votes with absolute certainty, knowing that each ID can be attributed to one vote, no fakes can be created, and that tampering is impossible.
